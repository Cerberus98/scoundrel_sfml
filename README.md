Scoundrel
============
An attempt at refreshing on C++ and making a 2D game engine built around SFML.

Thusly named because I intend to produce a roguelike with it at some point. Get it?

Also, used as the basis for my Ludum Dare Entry August 23-26, 2013.


Instructions:
============

Install SFML. I found that it was better to compile and install it yourself from source. The binaries as they were compiled for OSX didn't function. Head over to [SFML Download Page](http://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) for details.

After that, just run make.
